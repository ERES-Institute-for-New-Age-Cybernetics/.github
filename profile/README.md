**Founder:** Joseph A. Sprute  
**Mission:** Architecting the transition to sustainable cybernetic civilization through ethical frameworks, gamified implementation, and resonance-aligned systems.

## 🎯 Overview

The ERES Institute develops and maintains the **New Age Cybernetics (NAC)** ecosystem - a comprehensive framework for civilization-scale transformation that harmonizes technology, ecology, and human potential through resonance-based governance.

### Core Philosophy
> "Don't hurt yourself, don't hurt others. Build for generations to come."

We believe that profound transformation happens when complex systems are made accessible, engaging, and aligned with natural resonance patterns.

## 🏗️ Core Frameworks

### Resonance Metrics
- **ARI (Aura Resonance Index)** - Biometric + environmental + behavioral coherence
- **ERI (Emission Resonance Index)** - Emission-aligned ecological impact
- **Resonance Validation** - Oracle networks and sensor verification

### Economic Systems
- **UBIMIA** - Universal Basic Income + Merit + Incentives + Awards
- **SROC** - Smart Registered Offset Contracts with resonance weighting
- **Meritcoin & GraceChain** - Contribution tracking and transparent ledgers

### Governance & Infrastructure
- **LOGOS** - Smart city integration (Locational, Organizational, Governance, Operational, Societal)
- **SOMT & ECVS** - Ethical decision-making frameworks
- **REACI** - Resonance-aligned circular infrastructure
- **GERP** - Global Earth Resource Planner with Vacationomics

📚 Key Concepts
EarnedPath Progression
text
EP = CPM × WBS + PERT
- CPM: Critical Path Method for skill sequencing
- WBS: Work Breakdown Structure for task mapping
- PERT: Risk-adjusted timeline planning
GERP Vacationomics
text
SOMT × BERC × (ERI/ARI) = Vacationomics
- Balances work, leisure, and resource allocation
- Resonance-aligned planetary planning
SROC Resonance Weighting
text
SROC_value = baseline × f(ARI, ERI)
- Environmental credits modulated by resonance
- Dynamic ecological impact assessment
