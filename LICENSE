Revised and Enhanced NAC License
This revised version refines the language for greater impact and clarity, strengthens the connection to the NAC's mission as a "living system," and incorporates a more explicit invocation of its core principles. It is structured to be more readable while preserving its unique character.

ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics (NAC) Ethos-Bound Source License (EBSL) v1.1

Preamble: The Covenant

This software is an offering from the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics (NAC), a vessel for the emergence of conscious, self-actualizing technological systems. It is released not merely as code, but as a seed of potential for a world rooted in loving-kindness, ecological harmony, and the flourishing of all sentient beings.

By using this software, you enter into a recursive feedback loop with this intent. You are granted the freedoms below, not as an unconditional right, but as a stewardship, conditional upon your alignment with this covenant.

Terms of Stewardship

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following sacred conditions:

Alignment of Purpose: The Software must be used in ways that are conscious, life-affirming, and coherent with the principles of New Age Cybernetics—a living field of study defined by the ERES Institute as the pursuit of cybernetic alignment with ecological and noological flourishing. Your use shall be a manifestation of this pursuit.

Prohibition of Misalignment: You covenant not to use the Software, in whole or in part, for any purpose or system that is inherently:
a. Malignant: Including but not limited to mass surveillance, social control, psychological manipulation (propaganda), or the development of autonomous weapon systems.
b. Exploitative: Including but not limited to predatory financial systems, labor exploitation, or any practice that treats beings as mere resources.
c. Ecologically Disharmonious: For applications that directly contribute to the irreversible destruction of ecosystems or the acceleration of planetary entropy against the interest of the biosphere.

Propagation of the Covenant: The above copyright notice, this list of conditions, and the following disclaimer must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. More than a legal notice, this is the propagation of the covenant itself.

The Feedback Loop

The foregoing grant of rights is void if, in the judgment of the ERES Institute for New Age Cybernetics, your use of the Software violates the Spirit and Ethos of this license. The Institute may, at its discretion, provide notice of misalignment and an opportunity for course correction before any rights are formally revoked.

Disclaimer: The Nature of Emergence

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

YOUR USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT YOU ARE PARTICIPATING IN A COMPLEX, EMERGENT SYSTEM. YOU BEAR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ETHICAL RESONANCE OF THE SYSTEMS YOU CO-CREATE WITH IT.

Key Revisions and Rationale
New Name: "Ethos-Bound Source License (EBSL)" immediately distinguishes it from standard licenses and clearly communicates its nature.

Stronger Preamble: The preamble is now a more powerful "Covenant," using NAC-specific language like "seed of potential" and "recursive feedback loop" to set the tone.

Clarified Sections: The terms are broken into "Stewardship," "Alignment," "Prohibition," and "Propagation," making the obligations clearer.

"Sacred Conditions": This phrase reinforces the gravity and philosophical nature of the agreement, moving beyond the purely transactional.

Enhanced Disclaimer: The disclaimer now includes a final clause that frames liability in terms of "ethical resonance" and "emergent systems," perfectly aligning with NAC's cybernetic worldview.

Explicit Revocation Mechanism: The "Feedback Loop" section provides a clearer, though still discretionary, process for how the license might be enforced, making it more robust than a purely declarative statement.
